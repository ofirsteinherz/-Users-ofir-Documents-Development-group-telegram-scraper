    "Overview of the Pipeline for Real-Time Event Management\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve your goal of managing, updating, and monitoring events in real-time, based on new data coming from Telegram, we can design a pipeline that works with your pre-defined list of event types (like protests, fires, etc.) and updates them as new messages come in. The pipeline will:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tDefine Event Types: Pre-set a list of known event types (like protests, fires, accidents).\n",
    "\t2.\tTrack Active Events: Maintain a list of currently active events, where each event has real-time updates.\n",
    "\t3.\tHandle New Messages: For every new message, classify it into an existing event (if applicable), or create a new event if it introduces a new topic.\n",
    "\t4.\tUpdate Events: Continuously update the information for each active event based on new messages.\n",
    "\t5.\tUse GPT for Classification and Summarization: GPT will help to classify the incoming messages and enrich the data by providing event summaries and updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipeline Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tInitialize Event Types and Active Events:\n",
    "\t•\tCreate a predefined list of event types, e.g., [“Protest”, “Fire”, “Accident”, etc.].\n",
    "\t•\tKeep an event registry for tracking active events, which will get updated in real-time.\n",
    "\t2.\tProcess Incoming Telegram Messages:\n",
    "\t•\tFor each new message from Telegram:\n",
    "\t•\tUse GPT to classify it based on event types.\n",
    "\t•\tCheck if the message belongs to an existing event (based on time, location, and content).\n",
    "\t•\tIf it matches an existing event, update that event with new information (using GPT to summarize the updates).\n",
    "\t•\tIf it doesn’t match, create a new event with a new entry in the active event registry.\n",
    "\t3.\tUse GPT for Classification and Summarization:\n",
    "\t•\tGPT will help by analyzing each incoming message, classifying it into an event type, and generating a concise summary of the event as it evolves.\n",
    "\t4.\tReal-Time Updates:\n",
    "\t•\tThe system will run periodically (e.g., every minute) to check for new messages, classify them, and update events accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposed Code Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "We can follow a structure similar to your example, where a TelegramMessageProcessor class handles incoming messages, and GPT is used for event classification and updates. Let’s start by defining our EventProcessor class, which will handle classification and updates in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Main flow\n",
    "client = OpenAIClient(api_key=\"your_openai_api_key\")  # Assuming OpenAI client instance\n",
    "processor = TelegramMessageProcessor(client)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process incoming message\n",
    "new_message = \"Massive protest in the city center about the new tax policy.\"\n",
    "processor.process_new_message(new_message)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check active events\n",
    "active_events = processor.get_active_events()\n",
    "for event in active_events:\n",
    "    print(f\"Event Type: {event['type']}, Last Update: {event['last_update']}, Summary: {event['summary']}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Components Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tEvent Classification:\n",
    "\t•\tGPT is used to classify the message into one of the predefined event types (Protest, Fire, Accident, Unknown), based on the content of the message.\n",
    "\t2.\tEvent Updates:\n",
    "\t•\tOnce the message is classified, the system checks if an event of that type is already active.\n",
    "\t•\tIf it is, it updates the event with the new message and regenerates the summary using GPT.\n",
    "\t•\tIf it’s a new event, the system creates a new event entry.\n",
    "\t3.\tSummarization:\n",
    "\t•\tGPT is used to summarize the series of messages related to an event. As more messages are received, the summary is updated.\n",
    "\t4.\tActive Events Overview:\n",
    "\t•\tThe system provides a real-time view of all active events with their current summaries and timestamps for when they were last updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-Time Processing Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tThe system can run periodically, say every minute, to check for new messages, classify them, and update events accordingly.\n",
    "\t•\tThe structure allows you to continuously enrich the information about an event as new details come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume the following sequence of messages arrives:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tMessage 1: “Protest in London against tax reforms.”\n",
    "\t2.\tMessage 2: “Fire breaks out near the protest area in London.”\n",
    "\t3.\tMessage 3: “More protesters joining the march in Manchester.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Message 1 will be classified as a “Protest” event, creating a new entry.\n",
    "Message 2 might be classified as both “Protest” and “Fire”, depending on the system’s configuration, potentially updating both events or linking the events together.\n",
    "Message 3 will update the “Protest” event with additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the messages are processed, the system will build a timeline of events with real-time updates and summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach leverages GPT to handle both classification and summarization tasks while maintaining an up-to-date overview of active events."
